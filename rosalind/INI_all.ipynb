    "Considering the life and living organic material, the cell is recognised as the building block of life. The centre of the activity is considered to be in the nucles (only in eukaryotic cells, where it is present). The nucleus is filled with macromolecules called chromatin. During eukaryotic cell division (mitosis), most of the chromatin condenses into long, thin strings called chromosomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "One class of the macromolecules contained in chromatin are called nucleic acids. Nucleic acids are polymers, or repeating chains of smaller, similarly structured molecules known as monomers. Because of their tendency to be long and thin, nucleic acid polymers are commonly called strands.\n",
    "\n",
    "The nucleic acid monomer is called a nucleotide and is used as a unit of strand length (abbreviated to nt). Each nucleotide is formed of three parts: a sugar molecule, a negatively charged ion called a phosphate, and a compound called a nucleobase (\"base\" for short). Polymerisation is achieved as the sugar of one nucleotide bonds to the phosphate of the next nucleotide in the chain, which forms a sugar-phosphate backbone for the nucleic acid strand. A key point is that the nucleotides of a specific type of nucleic acid always contain the same sugar and phosphate molecules, and they differ only in their choice of base. Thus, one strand of a nucleic acid can be differentiated from another based solely on the order of its bases; this ordering of bases defines a nucleic acid's primary structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "A strand of deoxyribose nucleic acid (DNA), in which the sugar is called deoxyribose, posseses only four choices for nucleobases, molecules called adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), and thymine (T).\n",
    "\n",
    "DNA is found in all living organisms on Earth, including bacteria; it is even found in many viruses (which are often considered to be nonliving). Because of its importance, we reserve the term genome to refer to the sum total of the DNA contained in an organism's chromosomes."

    "RNA is a second nucleic acid existing alongside DNA in the chromatin and contains a different sugar called ribose, which came to be known as ribose nucleic acid (RNA). RNA differs from DNA in that it contains a base called uracil in place of thymine. RNA is present in the cells of all life forms on Earth.\n",

    "The structure of DNA and RNA is similar because DNA seves as a blueprint for the creation of special sort of RNA, called messenger RNA (mRNA). mRNA is created during RNA transcription, during which a strand of DNA is used as a template for constructing a strand of RNA by copying nucleotides one at a time, where uracil is used in place of thymine.\n",

For this reason, RNA strings are constructed from the alphabet {A, C, G, U}, whose symbols represent the bases adenine, cytosine, guanine, and uracil.

    "The primary structure of a nucleic acid is determined by the ordering of its nucleobases along the sugar-phosphate backbone that constitutes the bonds of the nucleic acid polymer.  Yet primary structure tells us nothing about the larger, 3-dimensional shape of the molecule, which is vital for a complete understanding of nucleic acids.\n",
    "\n",
    "Watson and Crick proposed the following structure for DNA: \n",
    "1. The DNA molecule is made up of two strands, running in opposite directions.\n",
    "2. Each base bonds to a base in the opposite strand. Adenine always bonds with thymine, and cytosine always bonds with guanine; the complement of a base is the base to which it always bonds.\n",
    "3. The two strands are twisted together into a long spiral staircase structure called a double helix.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because they dictate how bases from different strands interact with each other, (1) and (2) above compose the secondary structure of DNA. (3) describes the 3-dimensional shape of the DNA molecule, or its tertiary structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "In light of Watson and Crick's model, the bonding of two complementary bases is called a base pair (bp). Therefore, the length of a DNA molecule will commonly be given in bp instead of nt. By complementarity, once we know the order of bases on one strand, we can immediately deduce the sequence of bases in the complementary strand. These bases will run in the opposite order to match the fact that the two strands of DNA run in opposite directions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The reverse complement of a DNA string is formed by reversing the string and taking the complement of each symbol.\n",
    "\n",
    "We must reverse the string in addition to taking complements because of the directionality of DNA: DNA replication and transcription occurs from the 3' end to the 5' end, and the 3' end of one strand is opposite from the 5' end of the complementary strand. Thus, if we were to simply take complements, then we would be reading the second strand in the wrong direction."

    "### Theory\n",
    "A quick method used by early computer software to determine the language of a given piece of text was to analyze the frequency with which each letter appeared in the text. This strategy was used because each language tends to exhibit its own letter frequencies, and as long as the text under consideration is long enough, software will correctly recognize the language quickly and with a very low error rate. See Figure 1 for a table compiling English letter frequencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may ask: what in the world does this linguistic problem have to do with biology? Although two members of the same species will have different genomes, they still share the vast percentage of their DNA; notably, 99.9% of the 3.2 billion base pairs in a human genome are common to almost all humans (i.e., excluding people having major genetic defects). For this reason, biologists will speak of the human genome, meaning an average-case genome derived from a collection of individuals. Such an average case genome can be assembled for any species, a challenge that we will soon discuss.\n",
    "\n",
    "The biological analog of identifying unknown text arises when researchers encounter a molecule of DNA from an unknown species. Because of the base pairing relations of the two DNA strands, cytosine and guanine will always appear in equal amounts in a double-stranded DNA molecule. Thus, to analyze the symbol frequencies of DNA for comparison against a database, we compute the molecule's GC-content, or the percentage of its bases that are either cytosine or guanine.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, the GC-content of most eukaryotic genomes hovers around 50%. However, because genomes are so long, we may be able to distinguish species based on very small discrepancies in GC-content; furthermore, most prokaryotes have a GC-content significantly higher than 50%, so that GC-content can be used to quickly differentiate many prokaryotes and eukaryotes by using relatively small DNA samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Note on Absolute Error\n",
    "We say that a number x is within an absolute error of y to a correct solution if x is within y of the correct solution. For example, if an exact solution is 6.157892, then for x to be within an absolute error of 0.001, we must have that |x−6.157892|<0.001, or 6.156892<x<6.158892.\n",
    "\n",
    "Error bounding is a vital practical tool because of the inherent round-off error in representing decimals in a computer, where only a finite number of decimal places are allotted to any number. After being compounded over a number of operations, this round-off error can become evident. As a result, rather than testing whether two numbers are equal with x=z, you may wish to simply verify that |x−z| is very small.\n",
    "\n",
    "The mathematical field of numerical analysis is devoted to rigorously studying the nature of computational approximation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise\n",
    "The GC-content of a DNA string is given by the percentage of symbols in the string that are 'C' or 'G'. For example, the GC-content of \"AGCTATAG\" is 37.5%. Note that the reverse complement of any DNA string has the same GC-content.\n",
    "\n",
    "DNA strings must be labeled when they are consolidated into a database. A commonly used method of string labeling is called FASTA format. In this format, the string is introduced by a line that begins with '>', followed by some labeling information. Subsequent lines contain the string itself; the first line to begin with '>' indicates the label of the next string.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Rosalind's implementation, a string in FASTA format will be labeled by the ID \"Rosalind_xxxx\", where \"xxxx\" denotes a four-digit code between 0000 and 9999.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given: At most 10 DNA strings in FASTA format (of length at most 1 kbp each).\n",
    "\n",
    "Return: The ID of the string having the highest GC-content, followed by the GC-content of that string. Rosalind allows for a default error of 0.001 in all decimal answers unless otherwise stated; please see the note on absolute error below."

    "### Theory\n",
    "Modern laws of inheritance were first described by Gregor Mendel (an Augustinian Friar) in 1865. The contemporary hereditary model, called blending inheritance, stated that an organism must exhibit a blend of its parent's traits. This rule is obviously violated both empirically (consider the huge number of people who are taller than both their parents) and statistically (over time, blended traits would simply blend into the average, severely limiting variation).\n",
    "\n",
    "Mendel, working with thousands of pea plants, believed that rather than viewing traits as continuous processes, they should instead be divided into discrete building blocks called factors. Furthermore, he proposed that every factor possesses distinct forms, called alleles.\n",
    "\n",
    "In what has come to be known as his first law (also known as the law of segregation), Mendel stated that every organism possesses a pair of alleles for a given factor. If an individual's two alleles for a given factor are the same, then it is homozygous for the factor; if the alleles differ, then the individual is heterozygous. The first law concludes that for any factor, an organism randomly passes one of its two alleles to each offspring, so that an individual receives one allele from each parent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mendel also believed that any factor corresponds to only two possible alleles, the dominant and recessive alleles. An organism only needs to possess one copy of the dominant allele to display the trait represented by the dominant allele. In other words, the only way that an organism can display a trait encoded by a recessive allele is if the individual is homozygous recessive for that factor.\n",
    "\n",
    "We may encode the dominant allele of a factor by a capital letter (e.g., A\n",
    ") and the recessive allele by a lower case letter (e.g., a\n",
    "). Because a heterozygous organism can possess a recessive allele without displaying the recessive form of the trait, we henceforth define an organism's genotype to be its precise genetic makeup and its phenotype as the physical manifestation of its underlying traits.\n",
    "\n",
    "The different possibilities describing an individual's inheritance of two alleles from its parents can be represented by a Punnett square.\n",

    "### Random variables\n",
    "A variable that becomes any value from a range of specified values. \n",
    "\n",
    "The probability could be (a frequency of something / total number of possible outcomes). For example (Pr(x)), a sac with blue and red balls in a sack, blue = 3/5 probabily and red = 2/5 probability. They some up to 1. Another example(P(y)), 1st is taken out, probability of the second one is determined from the remaining and if we wanted to know the exact probability, we would have to multiply their probabilites that lead to our wanted one and summed with another option (2 colours, one per each).\n",

    "\n",
    "### Theory\n",
    "In “Translating RNA into Protein”, we examined the translation of RNA into an amino acid chain for the construction of a protein. When two amino acids link together, they form a peptide bond, which releases a molecule of water; see Figure 1. Thus, after a series of amino acids have been linked together into a polypeptide, every pair of adjacent amino acids has lost one molecule of water, meaning that a polypeptide containing n amino acids has had n−1 water molecules removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "More generally, a residue is a molecule from which a water molecule has been removed; every amino acid in a protein are residues except the leftmost and the rightmost ones. These outermost amino acids are special in that one has an \"unstarted\" peptide bond, and the other has an \"unfinished\" peptide bond. Between them, the two molecules have a single \"extra\" molecule of water (see the atoms marked in blue in Figure 2). Thus, the mass of a protein is the sum of masses of all its residues plus the mass of a single water molecule.\n",

    "There are two standard ways of computing the mass of a residue by summing the masses of its individual atoms. Its monoisotopic mass is computed by using the principal (most abundant) isotope of each atom in the amino acid, whereas its average mass is taken by taking the average mass of each atom in the molecule (over all naturally appearing isotopes).\n",
    "\n",
    "Many applications in proteomics rely on mass spectrometry, an analytical chemical technique used to determine the mass, elemental composition, and structure of molecules. In mass spectrometry, monoisotopic mass is used more often than average mass, and so all amino acid masses are assumed to be monoisotopic unless otherwise stated.\n",
    "\n",
    "The standard unit used in mass spectrometry for measuring mass is the atomic mass unit, which is also called the dalton (Da) and is defined as one twelfth of the mass of a neutral atom of carbon-12. The mass of a protein is the sum of the monoisotopic masses of its amino acid residues plus the mass of a single water molecule (whose monoisotopic mass is 18.01056 Da).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following several problems on applications of mass spectrometry, we avoid the complication of having to distinguish between residues and non-residues by only considering peptides excised from the middle of the protein. This is a relatively safe assumption because in practice, peptide analysis is often performed in tandem mass spectrometry. In this special class of mass spectrometry, a protein is first divided into peptides, which are then broken into ions for mass analysis.\n",

    "## FIB - Rabbits and Recurrence Relations (Loop/Con)\n",
    "### Theory\n",
    "In 1202, Leonardo of Pisa (commonly known as Fibonacci) considered a mathematical exercise regarding the reproduction of a population of rabbits. He made the following simplifying assumptions about the population:\n",
    "\n",
    "The population begins in the first month with a pair of newborn rabbits.\n",
    "Rabbits reach reproductive age after one month.\n",
    "In any given month, every rabbit of reproductive age mates with another rabbit of reproductive age.\n",
    "Exactly one month after two rabbits mate, they produce one male and one female rabbit.\n",
    "Rabbits never die or stop reproducing.\n",
    "Fibonacci's exercise was to calculate how many pairs of rabbits would remain in one year. We can see that in the second month, the first pair of rabbits reach reproductive age and mate. In the third month, another pair of rabbits is born, and we have two rabbit pairs; our first pair of rabbits mates again. In the fourth month, another pair of rabbits is born to the original pair, while the second pair reach maturity and mate (with three total pairs). The dynamics of the rabbit population are illustrated in Figure 1. After a year, the rabbit population boasts 144 pairs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although Fibonacci's assumption of the rabbits' immortality may seem a bit farfetched, his model was not unrealistic for reproduction in a predator-free environment: European rabbits were introduced to Australia in the mid 19th Century, a place with no real indigenous predators for them. Within 50 years, the rabbits had already eradicated many plant species across the continent, leading to irreversible changes in the Australian ecosystem and turning much of its grasslands into eroded, practically uninhabitable parts of the modern Outback (see Figure 2). In this problem, we will use the simple idea of counting rabbits to introduce a new computational topic, which involves building up large solutions from smaller ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise\n",
    "A sequence is an ordered collection of objects (usually numbers), which are allowed to repeat. Sequences can be finite or infinite. Two examples are the finite sequence (π,−2–√,0,π) and the infinite sequence of odd numbers (1,3,5,7,9,…). We use the notation an to represent the n-th term of a sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "A recurrence relation is a way of defining the terms of a sequence with respect to the values of previous terms. In the case of Fibonacci's rabbits from the introduction, any given month will contain the rabbits that were alive the previous month, plus any new offspring. A key observation is that the number of offspring in any month is equal to the number of rabbits that were alive two months prior. As a result, if Fn represents the number of rabbit pairs alive after the n-th month, then we obtain the Fibonacci sequence having terms Fn that are defined by the recurrence relation Fn=Fn−1+Fn−2 (with F1=F2=1 to initiate the sequence). Although the sequence bears Fibonacci's name, it was known to Indian mathematicians over two millennia ago.\n",
    "\n",
    "When finding the n-th term of a sequence defined by a recurrence relation, we can simply use the recurrence relation to generate terms for progressively larger values of n. This problem introduces us to the computational technique of dynamic programming, which successively builds up solutions by using the answers to smaller cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given: Positive integers n≤40 and k≤5. E.g., 5 3\n",
    "\n",
    "Return: The total number of rabbit pairs that will be present after n months, if we begin with 1 pair and in each generation, every pair of reproduction-age rabbits produces a litter of k rabbit pairs (instead of only 1 pair). E.g., 19"

    "## ORF - Open Reading Frames (Loop/Con)\n",
    "### Theory\n",
    "In “Transcribing DNA into RNA”, we discussed the transcription of DNA into RNA, and in “Translating RNA into Protein”, we examined the translation of RNA into a chain of amino acids for the construction of proteins. We can view these two processes as a single step in which we directly translate a DNA string into a protein string, thus calling for a DNA codon table.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, three immediate wrinkles of complexity arise when we try to pass directly from DNA to proteins. First, not all DNA will be transcribed into RNA: so-called junk DNA appears to have no practical purpose for cellular function. Second, we can begin translation at any position along a strand of RNA, meaning that any substring of a DNA string can serve as a template for translation, as long as it begins with a start codon, ends with a stop codon, and has no other stop codons in the middle. As a result, the same RNA string can actually be translated in three different ways, depending on how we group triplets of symbols into codons. For example, ...AUGCUGAC... can be translated as ...AUGCUG..., ...UGCUGA..., and ...GCUGAC..., which will typically produce wildly different protein strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise\n",
    "Either strand of a DNA double helix can serve as the coding strand for RNA transcription. Hence, a given DNA string implies six total reading frames, or ways in which the same region of DNA can be translated into amino acids: three reading frames result from reading the string itself, whereas three more result from reading its reverse complement.\n",
    "\n",
    "An open reading frame (ORF) is one which starts from the start codon and ends by stop codon, without any other stop codons in between. Thus, a candidate protein string is derived by translating an open reading frame into amino acids until a stop codon is reached.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given: A DNA string s of length at most 1 kbp in FASTA format.\n",
