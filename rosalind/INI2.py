# calculation of the size of a square on the hypotenuse (right-angled triangle)

# input side lengths as variables
a = int(input('size of "a" side: ')) # size of 'a' side
b = int(input('size of "b" side: ')) # size of 'b' side

# calcualate (using exponentiation)
square = (a**2 + b**2)

# print the results (of calculation)
print('square on the hypotenuse:', square)
