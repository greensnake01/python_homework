# **Greetings traveller, welcome to my *python_homework* repository!**

## Contents
1) Directory - *python_homework* = navigation in the *python_homework* directory
2) Subdirectories = description of subdirectories
3) Usage = instructions and helpful commands
3) License = information about the licensing
4) Author = information about the author

## Directory - *python_homework*
The main purpose of the *python_homework* directory is to save and document progress made on projects in Python. The directory is connected to an online GitHub repository, which can be accessed here: <https://github.com/greensnake01/python_homework>. The online repository will be updated after achieved progress. Any pull requests are welcomed and can be further discussed. 

Not to get lost in the directory, see the following scheme:

python_homework \*

\   >aoc25

\   >data

\   >misc

\   >rosalind

\*Please, note that *.gitignore* does not track any files nor subdirectories within the **data** subdirectory.

## Subdirectories
The discription of the subdirectories will be added in the near future.

## Usage
Using a UNIX system and a CLI interface, to navigate in the directory use *cd* command with appropriate arguments as follows:

```bash
cd [directory/file]
```

To use and run the python programmes, you can either run them directly in the *python* or via a *conda* package and environment manager containing an environment with the *python* as shown:

```bash
cd
conda activate [environment]
python
py [directory/file]
```
