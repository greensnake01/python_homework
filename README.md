2) Subdirectories = description of subdirectories

## Directory - *python_homwork*
The main purpose of the *python_homework* directory is to save and document progress made working on projects in Python. The directory is connected to an online GitHub repository, see the following link: <https://github.com/greensnake01/python_homework>, which will be periodically updated after achieved progress. Any pull requests are welcomed and can be further discussed. 

Not to get lost in the directory, see the following scheme:

python_homework \*
|
|>aoc25
|
|>data
|
|>misc
|
|>rosalind

\*Please, note that *.gitignore* does not track any files nor subdirectories within the data subdirectory.

## Subdirectories
The discription of the subdirectories will be added in the near future.

## Usage
Using a UNIX system and a CLI interface, to navigate in the directory use *cd* command with appropriate arguments as follows:

```bash
cd [directory/file]
```

To use and run the python programmes, you can either run them directly in the *python* or via *conda* package and environment manager containing an environment with *python* as shown:

```bash
cd
conda activate [environment]
python
py [directory/file]
```
